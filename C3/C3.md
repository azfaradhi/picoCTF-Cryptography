## Problem
```
This is the Custom Cyclical Cipher!
Download the ciphertext here.
Download the encoder here.
Enclose the flag in our wrapper for submission. If the flag was "example" you would submit "picoCTF{example}".
```

* [ciphertext.py](./ciphertext)
* [convert.py](./convert.py)

## Hint

1. Modern crypto schemes don't depend on the encoder to be secret, but this one does.

## Solution

1. Given the convert.py file. The key is to make a new file, called dec_convert.py that reverse the step convert.py file do. You can see the code on dec_convert.py
2. Run the program, will give us this output.
    ```
    #res.py

    #asciiorder
    #fortychars
    #selfinput
    #pythontwo

    chars = ""
    from fileinput import input
    for line in input():
        chars += line
    b = 1 / 1

    for i in range(len(chars)):
        if i == b * b * b:
            print chars[i] #prints
            b += 1 / 1
    ```
3. As it shown, this file will do "selfinput" method. So, just run this command on python
    ```
    python3 res.py res.py
    ```
    will give us this output
    ```
    a
    d
    l
    i
    b
    s
    ```

### Flag

`picoCTF{adlibs}`
